Idea: Barbershop Website 

Project Description: 
	For our final project, we are creating a website that allows clients to book an appointment with a barber through a user interface. 
  On our website there will be a calendar with the barber’s availability and the user will be able to select a certain date to book. 
  For each date they select, certain time slots will be available on the slide down select. 
  The user will choose a certain day of the week, and also what time they want (military time). 
  Everytime the user wants to press the “Book appointment” button, they will have a pop up that tells them :

  - Their full name
  - Their cell phone number 
  - Their email 
  - what type of haircut they want
  - what day they want the haircut
  - what time they want the haircut 

After the user has entered this information, their appointment will show up on the Google calendar like graph. 
Each haircut will be 1 hour long and depending on what time they choose, it will start at that time and one hour after that. 
After the user chooses this time, the time slot for that day will disappear from the dropdown menu. 

For the nav bar, we are including a home page, an about page, a booking page, and a contact page. 
The home page will include pictures of recent work on a slide show using an NPM. 
On the about page, we will include the barber’s mission statement and descriptions of the team. 
The booking page will have the calendar and also allow users to make an appointment with the barber. 
Finally, the contact page will have the contact information of the barber and where to reach out.
